My journey in Italy began with a visit to the city of Naples, or Naples in English. Naples is an excellent base for day trips to Capri, Pompeii, or the Amalfi Coast.

While in Naples, I decided to visit Capri and Pompeii. The reason is simple, as photos scattered on the Internet show how beautiful Capri and its blue sea are, and my curiosity about the ancient city of Pompeii, which was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

On the first day in Naples, I decided to rest because I had previously suffered from chickenpox. (Hopefully, no one got infected because of me). On the second day, my friends and I decided to visit the island of Capri. The island, located in the Gulf of Naples, can be reached by ferry, with a journey time of approximately 50 to 90 minutes from Naples. The one-way ticket price ranges from 14 to 24 Euros. Tickets can be purchased online or directly at the harbor. It's important to note that there are two ports serving the ferry route from Naples to Capri, Calata Porta di Massa and Molo Beverello. Please pay attention to both of these ports; although they are close, it would be very frustrating if you end up at the wrong one.

One of the main tours offered in Capri is to tour the island by boat and enter the caves that offer blue water reflections, one of which is the Blue Grotto. But this time, we chose to go hiking and walk to Monte Salero, the highest point on the island.

### Walking from Marina Grande Harbor to Piazetta

The ferry from Naples docks in Marina Grande, Capri. From there, I decided to walk to Piazetta, which can be considered the center of Capri, where there are many restaurants and shops selling trinkets. To get to Piazetta, besides walking, you can use the funicular to reach this place. Since it is located at a high altitude, you can see the Marina Grande harbor from above and enjoy the view of the blue sea from Piazetta.

We chose to walk because it was more economical and allowed us to enjoy the views offered by the island. During the 1 km journey, we had to be ready to climb every step. When the journey felt exhausting, we just needed to look back to see the sea and the harbor, and the fatigue would disappear, motivating us to reach Piazetta.

### Walking from Piazetta to Belvedere of Punta Cannone

After having lunch, we decided to walk to Belvedere of Punta Cannone to see another side of the island of Capri. The journey here is about 1 km according to the Google Maps application. While walking, we passed through the homes of local residents. The path here is in the form of narrow alleys and not as crowded as in Piazetta.

Upon reaching Belvedere of Punta Cannone, we were immediately treated to the view of the blue sea and high cliffs. When you are here, you can walk a little to the Giardini di Augusto Viewpoint. Here, you can see the winding road from the top of the cliffs to the beach called Via Krupp.

### Returning from Belvedere of Punta Cannone to Marina Grande

After walking quite far to the other side of the island of Capri, we decided to return to Marina Grande. We did this because there is a bus available at Marina Grande to reach Monte Salero. Also, the reason we didn't walk was that the road there is very steep, and we wanted to take another look at Marina Grande.

### Taking the Bus from Marina Grande to Anacapri

The bus fare is approximately 2 Euros, and the bus is of a mini size. You also have to wait for about 25 minutes because the bus frequency is around every 25 minutes. To pass the time, you can walk around Marina Grande or even play in the water because there is a beach near this bus stop.

Once we arrived in Anacapri, we explored this city. Anacapri is located at a higher elevation than Piazetta, which we visited earlier. The buildings here look neater, and the walls of the buildings are dominated by white. From Anacapri, we took a chairlift to the highest point on the island of Capri, Monte Salero. I spent around 11 Euros for a round trip to Monte Salero.

However, when we arrived at the top, the weather was quite cloudy, so we couldn't see the entire island from this point. It's advisable to come here earlier in the day when the clouds are not as gathered on Monte Salero.

### Walking from Anacapri to Marina Grande

After failing to get a good view from Monte Salero, we decided to walk from Anacapri to Marina Grande. This time, the journey was relatively easy because the path was downhill, and there were no stairs to climb, only to descend.

Moreover, the scenery during the journey could be considered better than when we went to Piazetta because the route we took was located on the edge of cliffs and at a fairly high position. So, our eyes were treated better during the return journey. It took us about 2 km to get back to Marina Grande.

Capri can be considered my first experience during the trip to Europe in visiting an island. The photos on the internet turned out not to be misleading. Capri indeed offers beautiful scenery and enchanting blue sea. It's highly recommended for sea lovers to visit this place.
