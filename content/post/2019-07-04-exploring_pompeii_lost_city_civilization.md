When you visit Naples, don't miss the opportunity to explore Pompeii, an ancient city buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. 

Due to this volcanic eruption, the entire city was lost to civilization, and its inhabitants who couldn't escape perished. Why is Pompeii worth visiting? One of the reasons is that it offers a glimpse into the life of the ancient Romans.

To reach Pompeii from Naples, you can take the Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale with a one-way ticket costing 3 Euros. Trains run every 30 minutes on this route. Traveling in the direction of Sorrento, the journey takes approximately 36 minutes. When taking this train, you should alight at the Pompei Scavi station. From there, it's a short walk to the entrance gate of the ancient city of Pompeii. The ticket price for entry to this area is 15 Euros, and you can check ticket availability at [Pompeii Official Website](http://www.pompeiisites.org/).

As the ancient city of Pompeii covers quite a vast area, you might want to plan to spend a whole day exploring it. For those with limited time, please visit this link: [Pompeii Itineraries](https://www.visitpompeiivesuvius.com/en/pompeii).

Since I spent a full day in Pompeii, I'd like to share some unique places I encountered through the following photos:

After visiting Pompeii, one can't help but marvel at the prosperity this city enjoyed in its heyday. It provided extensive facilities such as sports centers and art venues. It's hard to imagine what would have happened if Pompeii hadn't been destroyed in the 1st century. Perhaps it would be one of Italy's major cities today. By visiting Pompeii, it's as if we step back in time and witness the lifestyle of ancient Roman society. If you have an interest in history, Pompeii is a must-visit destination to experience what it was like to be an ancient Roman for a day.
