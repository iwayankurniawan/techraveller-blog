Travelers often list Munich or Berlin as must-visit cities when touring Germany. However, if you have an extra day or some spare time, consider visiting other cities, one of which is Bremen.

The advantage of exploring cities that aren't tourist hotspots is that the places you visit won't be too crowded with tourists, allowing you to have an authentic experience of the country that may not be offered to tourists.

If you decide to spend a day in Bremen, I've prepared a list of 4 places you might consider visiting for a stroll. All of these places are within walking distance, so get ready to use your feet, and here's the list:

## 1. Bremen Market Square

The first place on my list is **Bremen Market Square**, or *Marktplatz* in German. This place is a public square and the center of Bremen, where you can find several historical landmarks.

These include *Bremen Rathaus* or Town Hall, the 600-year-old *Roland* statue, the *Cathedral of St. Peter*, and the *Town Musicians of Bremen* statue.

*Roland Statue (Left) and Town Hall (Right) are part of the UNESCO World Heritage list*

The *Town Musicians of Bremen* statue is based on a Brothers Grimm folk tale. It's unique because many people come here to take photos while touching the front legs of the donkey. It is said that touching the donkey's legs will bring you back to the city.

## 2. Böttcherstraße

One of the unique features of Bremen is the presence of several historic alleys or small streets that still maintain a medieval style. One of them is **Böttcherstraße**, which was built in 1920. You can purchase handicrafts and souvenirs in this alley.

## 3. Schnoor

**Schnoor** is a residential complex in Bremen that still maintains its medieval style. It consists of several small alleys and colorful buildings, making Schnoor a delightful place to explore.

I spent quite some time in this district because it's not too crowded, and the numerous small alleys make you want to explore this place even longer.

The history of this district dates back to the 14th century, and the architecture of this place has been preserved to this day. There are many restaurants, coffee shops, and souvenir stores in this area, so you can enjoy a medieval-style coffee break here.

## 4. Mühle Am Wall

Located in Bremen City Park, this windmill was built in 1699. It was damaged several times and the windmill you see today was constructed in 1898.

I included this location on the list because you can spend time in the park, which was once part of the city's defensive wall, while enjoying the view of the old windmill in the city.
