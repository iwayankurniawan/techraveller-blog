After exploring Venice to my heart's content, I finally arrived at my last destination in Italy, the city of Verona. Verona is located midway between Milan and Venice, and it usually serves as a transit point for travelers who prefer to find accommodation in Venice or Milan.

I chose to visit Verona because my flight back to Stockholm was located in this city. To avoid rushing on my way back, I decided to stay in this city for one night. Upon arrival in Verona, I immediately set off on foot to explore what Verona had to offer.

Since I was staying in an area near Porto Nuova station, I chose to explore the city of Verona on foot, which is my preferred mode of transportation.

The first place I headed to was Città Antica or the Historic center.

### Città Antica

Città Antica or the Historic center is the heart of the city of Verona. In this area, you can find the Arena di Verona, which is like a smaller version of the Colosseum, Casa di Giuletta or Juliet's house, Piazza dei Signori, Scaliger Tombs, and many more.

When you enter this area, you immediately feel like you've stepped back in time. The gate, which seems to be the remains of the old city wall, welcomes you and transports you to the old town of Verona.

What's interesting is that the Colosseum of Verona greets you as soon as you arrive here. I was surprised because I thought the Colosseum was only in Rome, but the Colosseum in Verona is much smaller and is still used for events such as theater and concerts.

Furthermore, the architecture of the city looks old and still maintains its vintage charm.

One of the bustling places is Juliet's house. Because Shakespeare set the backdrop for the story of Romeo and Juliet in Verona, people flock here to take photos with Juliet's statue. One of the famous scenes from Romeo and Juliet is said to have been set in this house, where Juliet approaches her balcony when called by Romeo.

### Castel San Pietro

After thoroughly exploring the city center of Verona, I decided to cross the Adige River to reach Castel San Pietro. Castel San Pietro is located on a hill and is perfect for admiring the panoramic view of the city of Verona from a height.

To reach the top of Castel San Pietro, you can either walk or take the funicular for 2 Euros.

Once at the top, you are treated to a view of the city of Verona and the Adige River that surrounds it. It's perfect for spending your evening here.

### Lake Garda

The next day, before heading back to Stockholm, I took the time to visit Lake Garda, which is a 13-minute train ride away.

Due to limited time, I decided to go to the nearest point to Lake Garda from Verona, which is Peschiera Del Garda.

Although this is not the primary destination for those who want to see Lake Garda, this place provides direct train access from Verona to Lake Garda.

Arriving here, you can immediately see Lake Garda, and it's a suitable place for swimming, sunbathing, and even renting a boat to sail on Lake Garda.

The turquoise blue color dominates the view of the lake. I spent my time here enjoying the warmth of the sun and the coolness of Lake Garda.

If you have extra time, Verona can be on your list of cities to visit in Italy. Verona offers many experiences and is not just a transit point for travelers.
