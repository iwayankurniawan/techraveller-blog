When you've reached Northern Italy, it's a must to visit this city. The city of Venice is located in the Venetian Lagoon and was the economic center in the Middle Ages.

We all know what makes Venice famous: the skill of the Venetians in building buildings in this lagoon. This allowed a city to stand proudly in the middle of the water.

This city, which has no roads and motor vehicles, relies on water transportation such as boats and boats to move from one point to another. If you look closely, you'll find many canals here, which is Venice's distinctive feature. There are so many canals in Venice that there are 400 bridges to help you cross them.

*Early view upon arriving at Venezia Santa Lucia Station*

I initially started in Milan, and to get to Venice, I took a train which took about 2.5 hours. For those planning to visit Venice, pay attention to the train station where you'll stop. There are two stations: Venice Mestre and Venezia Santa Lucia. Venice Mestre station takes you to the mainland Venice, which does not have canals and is not on the water. So, the station you want to go to is Venezia Santa Lucia, which is located in the waterfront area.

Choosing accommodation in Venice can be tricky. Accommodation prices in Venice are quite high compared to other cities in Italy. If you plan to stay in Venice, it's highly recommended to stay near the Venezia Santa Lucia station. Since Venice is only accessible on foot, staying near the train station will make it very easy to move your luggage. If you choose accommodation far from the station, you may need to be prepared to spend a significant amount on a water taxi, which can be quite expensive.

In Venice, I spent approximately one full day, and since I started my journey the next day, I had to leave my luggage at a baggage storage facility. There is a baggage storage facility at the station, but the queue can be quite long because the storage system is still manual. So, allocate extra time if you plan to leave your luggage; it costs about 6 Euros per bag for 5 hours, if I'm not mistaken.

Finally, after all the details were settled, I was ready to explore Venice. I had a list of places ready, and I reached them all on foot. On that day, I walked approximately 15 km in Venice, so it's no wonder that "fatigue" became the title of this article.

### Rialto Bridge & Grand Canal

![Rialto Bridge helping people cross the Grand Canal](/img/post/2019-07-20-walking_until_exhausted_in_the_water_city_of_venice/venice6.jpg)
*Rialto Bridge helping people cross the Grand Canal*

The first thing people do when they arrive in Venice is visit the Rialto Bridge. On this bridge, you can immediately see the Grand Canal. This canal is the largest canal that divides Venice and is the main traffic route for ships passing through Venice. When you look at the Grand Canal from the Rialto Bridge, you realize that Venice is truly above the water. The proximity of buildings to the water's surface makes Venice's buildings appear to be floating on the water.

The Rialto Bridge serves to connect the San Marco and San Polo districts. When you pass this bridge, you'll find several shops selling typical Venetian trinkets.

*There's a mall near Rialto Bridge, where you can get a view of all of Venice from a height*

Near the Rialto Bridge, there is a mall called T Fondaco dei Tedeschi by DFS. This mall offers a [terrace view](https://www.dfs.com/en/venice/t-fondaco-rooftop-terrace) for free to visitors. So, you can see a 360-degree view of the city of Venice from a height when you are in this building. If you are interested in going up to this building, please book your schedule [here](https://www.dfs.com/en/venice/t-fondaco-rooftop-terrace).

### St. Mark’s Square

The next place that must be visited is St. Mark's Square. To get here, it's about a 600-meter walk from Rialto Bridge. As the largest square in Venice, this square also serves as the city's government complex. Here, you'll find St. Mark’s Basilica, Doge Palace, and San Marco Campanile.

When you look at the front of St. Mark’s Basilica, you'll see prominent golden mosaics. This basilica is evidence of the golden days of Venice's past.

San Marco Campanile is the tallest building in Venice, standing at approximately 98.6 meters. This building serves as a watchtower and is a replica because the original building collapsed in 1902.

### Venice Snapshots

In this section, there are several photos that I took while in Venice. From here, I understand that the entire Venice area is a tourist attraction, and in this article, I cannot list all the places to visit in Venice. Because everything Venice offers is a tourist attraction, and the experience Venice offers is when walking around Venice.
