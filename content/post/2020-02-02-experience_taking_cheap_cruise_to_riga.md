After visiting Helsinki, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg by cruise, it's now Riga's turn to be explored. Riga, the capital of Latvia, is always one of the weekend getaway destinations for people living in Stockholm and the surrounding areas.

With a budget of 700 SEK or about 1,050,000 Indonesian rupiahs, we can get a room that can accommodate 4 people. The journey from Stockholm to Riga takes approximately 14 hours. Usually, the ship departs at 5:00 PM and arrives at 9:00 AM the next morning.

During the journey, there are many performances such as live music, cabaret, karaoke, and various types of restaurants to fill our time.

Upon arrival in Riga, I decided to visit Old Town Riga, and this old town location can be reached on foot from the port. Unlike most port cities, which are directly located by the sea, Riga is situated on the Daugava River, so ships have to navigate the river before reaching the city of Riga.

I had about 7 hours to explore Old Town Riga. There are several places I planned to visit, such as:

- Dome Square and Riga Cathedral
- House of the Blackheads and Latvian Rifleman Statue
- Powder Tower
- Laima Clock and Freedom Monument

Due to very limited time, I only managed to visit these places. At least, there are some places that still maintain an authentic medieval style in this city.
