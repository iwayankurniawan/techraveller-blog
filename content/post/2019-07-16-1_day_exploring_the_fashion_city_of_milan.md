description: "After thoroughly exploring Cinque Terre, it's time to return to the bustling city. The next city on my itinerary is the Fashion Capital, Milan, Italy. I only briefly visited this city because my main destination was Venice.

Milan's strategic location between Cinque Terre and Venice led me to decide to make a stop in Italy's second most populous city.

During my time in Milan, I only visited three places, and the rest of my time was spent resting because my legs were very sore after hiking in Cinque Terre.

As usual, I purchased a 24-hour transportation ticket to get around the city, which was very affordable at only 4.5 Euros. This price is quite cheap compared to transportation costs in other countries."

After thoroughly exploring Cinque Terre, it's time to return to the bustling city. The next city on my itinerary is the Fashion Capital, Milan, Italy. I only briefly visited this city because my main destination was Venice.

Milan's strategic location between Cinque Terre and Venice led me to decide to make a stop in Italy's second most populous city.

During my time in Milan, I only visited three places, and the rest of my time was spent resting because my legs were very sore after hiking in Cinque Terre.

As usual, I purchased a 24-hour transportation ticket to get around the city, which was very affordable at only 4.5 Euros. This price is quite cheap compared to transportation costs in other countries.

Here are the places I visited in Milan:

### Duomo

This is a must-visit location when in Milan, but due to the high demand, the queue to enter the church was quite long. So, I decided to take photos in front of the Cathedral instead. The building is one of the most striking and highly detailed.

### Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II

If you face Duomo, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is on your left. This 19th-century shopping center sells high-end and branded goods. If you've traveled all the way to the fashion capital of Milan and don't shop, you might feel incomplete, so this place is suitable for shopping.

Additionally, the roof of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele is a popular photography spot for tourists. I was initially confused when I saw this roof because it resembles the Galleria Umberto I in Naples. It turns out that the Galleria Umberto I in Naples was built later to commemorate the earlier construction of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.

### Castello Sforzesco

Before Italy was united, Milan had its own governing region. Castello Sforzesco served as the center of government for the Milanese region. If you want to experience entering an Italian castle for free, you can visit this castle. There are many museums to explore within the castle. Additionally, once you've finished exploring the castle, there is a spacious park behind it called Parco Sempione ready for you to wander around.

However, if you have more time in Milan, I highly recommend taking a day trip outside the city, such as to Lake Como or Verona. From my experience, the places I mentioned above are enjoyable to visit and can all be explored in half a day.
